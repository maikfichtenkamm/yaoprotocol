Alice input is the accumulated sum 3!Alice and Bob use the circuit of a 4-bit full adder. The circuit representation is printed in the following. Refer to the documentation for a better overviewAlice sends the following garbled tables to Bob.The gates are shown in the order in which they are evaluated. In addition, all combinations of the external values of input wires of a gate are transmitted and their encrypted contents.These are shown in the form: [input_wire_a, e_value_a][input_wire_b, e_value_b]: encrypted content of output
